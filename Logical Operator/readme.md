# **Logical Operators in SQL**
- Logical operators help combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause. They return TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN.

## **Common Logical Operators:**
- **AND**	Returns true if both conditions are true
- 	age > 18 AND gender = 'Male'
- **OR**	Returns true if at least one condition is true
age < 18 OR age > 60
- **NOT**	Reverses the result of the condition
- NOT (gender = 'Female')
