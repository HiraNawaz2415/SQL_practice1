## **What is SQL?**
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to communicate with databases. It helps you store, manage, and retrieve data from a relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.
- In simple terms, if a database is like a digital filing cabinet, SQL is the language you use to open drawers, add new files, change existing ones, or remove what you don’t need.

- 🔍 Data Access: SQL allows you to retrieve exactly the information you need, no matter how complex the query is.

- 🛠️ Data Management: You can insert, update, or delete records in large databases with just a few commands.

- 🧱 Database Design: SQL helps create and structure databases (tables, relationships, constraints, etc.).

- 🔒 Security & Permissions: You can control who can access what in your database using SQL.

- 📊 Data Analysis: With advanced SQL, you can generate reports and insights from your data quickly.

- In short, SQL is essential for anyone working with data or databases, including developers, analysts, and administrators.

### **2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)**
- Used to work with the data inside the tables.

- **SELECT:** Retrieve data

- **UPDATE:** Modify existing data

- **DELETE:** Remove data

### **3. DCL (Data Control Language)**
- Used to control access to data.

- **GRANT:** Give user permissions
